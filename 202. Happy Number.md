# 202. Happy Number
## Question ‚ùì <br>
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.


Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: n = 19    
Output:true      
Explanation:   
12 + 92 = 82  
82 + 22 = 68  
62 + 82 = 10   
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

__Example 2:__  Input: n = 2  
Output: false        
<br>

## Constraints:

- 1 <= n <=  2 * <sup>31</sup>-1

# Code
```C#

public class Solution
{
    public bool IsHappy(int n)
    {
        if (n == 1 || n == 7)
            return true;
        while (n > 9)
        {
            double number = 0;
            foreach (var item in n.ToString())
                number += Math.Pow((double)(item - '0'), 2);
            n = (int)number;
        }
        if (n == 1 || n == 7)
            return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```
