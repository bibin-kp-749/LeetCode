# 1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return true if you can make arr equal to target or false otherwise.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]        
Output:true        
Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
1- Reverse subarray [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
2- Reverse subarray [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
3- Reverse subarray [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.

<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: target = [7], arr = [7]   
Output: true          
Explanation: arr is equal to target without any reverses.
<br>



      
__Example 3:__  Input: target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]  
Output: false        
Explanation: arr does not have value 9 and it can never be converted to target.

## Constraints:

- target.length == arr.length
- 1 <= target.length <= 1000
- 1 <= target[i] <= 1000
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

# Code
```C#

public class Solution
{
    public bool CanBeEqual(int[] target, int[] arr)
    {
        Array.Sort(arr);
        Array.Sort(target);
        for (int i = 0; i < target.Length; i++)
        {
            if (arr[i] != target[i])
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
