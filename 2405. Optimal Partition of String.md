# 2405. Optimal Partition of String
## Question ‚ùì <br>
Given a string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.
  
    
Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: s = "abacaba"     
Output: 4     
Explanation:   
Two possible partitions are ("a","ba","cab","a") and ("ab","a","ca","ba").  
It can be shown that 4 is the minimum number of substrings needed.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: s = "ssssss"  
Output: 6    
Explanation:   
The only valid partition is ("s","s","s","s","s","s").

## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10 <sup> 5 </sup>
- s consists of only English lowercase letters.

# Code
```C#
public class Solution
{
    public int PartitionString(string s)
    {
        int count = 1;
        string sentence = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < s.Length; i++)
        {
            if (!sentence.Contains(s[i]))
                sentence += s[i];
            else
            {
                sentence = "";
                sentence += s[i];
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```
