# 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word

## Question ‚ùì <br>
Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.

- For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
<br><br>
  Return the resulting string.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"   
Output: "dcbaefd"       
Explanation:  The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"      
Output: "zxyxxe"        
Explanation:  The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.  
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".     
<br>
__Example 2:__  Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"      
Output: "zxyxxe"        
Explanation:  The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.  
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".

## Constraints:

- 1 <= word.length <= 250
- word consists of lowercase English letters.
- ch is a lowercase English letter.


# Code
```c#
public class Solution
{
    public string ReversePrefix(string word, char ch)
    {
        int index = word.IndexOf(ch);
        if (index == -1)
            return word;
        string substring = word.Substring(0, index + 1);
        char[] chars = substring.ToCharArray().Reverse().ToArray();
        string hh = new String(chars);
        return word.Replace(substring, hh);
    }
}
```
