# 2085. Count Common Words With One Occurrence
## Question ‚ùì <br>
Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]      
Output:2      
Explanation: - "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]  
Output: 0        
Explanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.
<br>



      
__Example 3:__  Input: words1 = ["a","ab"], words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]  
Output: 1      
Explanation: The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".

## Constraints:

- 1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 1000
- 1 <= words1[i].length, words2[j].length <= 30
- words1[i] and words2[j] consists only of lowercase English letters.

# Code
```C#


public class Solution
{
    public int CountWords(string[] words1, string[] words2)
    {
        var unique = words1.Distinct().ToArray();
        List<string> list = new List<string>();
        int count = 0;
        foreach (var item in unique)
        {
            if (Array.IndexOf(words1, item) == Array.LastIndexOf(words1, item))
                list.Add(item);
        }
        foreach (var item in list)
        {
            int index1 = Array.IndexOf(words2, item);
            int index2 = Array.LastIndexOf(words2, item);
            if (index1 == -1 || index2 == -1)
                continue;
            else if (index1 == index2)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
