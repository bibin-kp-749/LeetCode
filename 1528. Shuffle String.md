# 1528. Shuffle String
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.

<br>
Return the shuffled string.

<br> 

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]   
Output: "leetcode"      
Explanation: In the given example:
As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling. 
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]  
Output: "abc"     
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
<br>
<br>
  
## Constraints:

- s.length == indices.length == n
- 1 <= n <= 100
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.
- 0 <= indices[i] < n
- All values of indices are unique.

# Code
```c#
public class Solution {
    public string RestoreString(string s, int[] indices){
        char[] array=new char[s.Length];
        int n=0;
        foreach(var i in indices){
            array[i]=s[n];
            n++;
        }        
        return new String(array);
    }
}
```
