## Question ‚ùì <br>
Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that is a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 2:__  Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]    
Output: ["et","code"]      
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
<br>



      
__Example 3:__  Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]

<br>
  
## Constraints:

- 1 <= words.length <= 100
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
- words[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of words are unique.

# Code
```C#
public class Solution
{
    public IList<string> StringMatching(string[] words)
    {
        IList<string> result = new List<string>();
        for (int i = 0; i < words.Length; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < words.Length; j++)
            {
                if (i != j)
                {
                    bool isexist = words[i].Contains(words[j]);
                    if (isexist)
                        result.Add(words[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        IList<string> res = result.Distinct().ToList();
        return res;
    }
}
```
