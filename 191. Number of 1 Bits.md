# 191. Number of 1 Bits
## Question ‚ùì <br>
Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of 
set bits
 it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: Input: n = 11    
Output:3        
Explanation: The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: n = 128    
Output: 1          
Explanation: The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.
<br>



      
__Example 3:__  Input: 2147483645   
Output: 30        
Explanation: The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.
<br>
  
## Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

# Code
```C#


public class Solution
{
    public int HammingWeight(int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        string res = Convert.ToString(n, 2);
        foreach (var item in res)
        {
            if (item == '1')
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```
