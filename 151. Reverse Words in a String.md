# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram
## Question ‚ùì <br>
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: s = "the sky is blue"      
Output: "blue is sky the"      
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: s = "  hello world  "   
Output: "world hello"      
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
<br>



      
__Example 3:__  Input: s = "a good   example"  
Output: "example good a"    
Explanation:You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 
<br>
  
## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 10 <pow>4</pow>
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.

# Code
```C#
public class Solution
{
    public string ReverseWords(string s)
    {
        string Str = "";
        string[] arr = s.Split(" ");
        Array.Reverse(arr);
        foreach (var item in arr)
        {
            Str += item;
            Str = Str.Trim();
            Str += " ";
        }
        return Str.Trim();
    }
}

```
