# 1331. Rank Transform of an Array
## Question ‚ùì <br>
Given an array of integers arr, replace each element with its rank.

The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:

- Rank is an integer starting from 1.
- The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.
- Rank should be as small as possible.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: arr = [40,10,20,30]     
Output:[4,1,2,3]      
Explanation: 40 is the largest element. 10 is the smallest. 20 is the second smallest. 30 is the third smallest..
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: arr = [100,100,100]  
Output:  [1,1,1]        
Explanation: Same elements share the same rank.
<br>



      
__Example 3:__  Input: arr = [37,12,28,9,100,56,80,5,12]  
Output: [5,3,4,2,8,6,7,1,3]      

<br>
  
## Constraints:

- 0 <= arr.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- -10<sup>9</sup> <= arr[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

# Code
```C#

public class Solution
{
    public int[] ArrayRankTransform(int[] arr)
    {
        Dictionary<int, int> pattern = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        int rank = 1;
        foreach (var item in arr.Distinct().Order())
        {
            pattern.Add(item, rank);
            rank++;
        }
        int[] res = new int[arr.Length];
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.Length; i++)
            res[i] = pattern[arr[i]];
        return res;
    }
}
```
