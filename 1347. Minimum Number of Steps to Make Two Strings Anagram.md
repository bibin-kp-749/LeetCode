# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

  
    
Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.

  
    
An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering..
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"     
Output: 1      
Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"     
Output: 5    
Explanation:  Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.
<br>



      
__Example 3:__  Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"  
Output: 0  
Explanation:"anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams.
<br>
  
## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10 <pow>4</pow>
- s.length == t.length
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters only.

# Code
```C#
public class Solution
{
    public int MinSteps(string s, string t)
    {
        var list = s.ToList();
        int count = 0;
        foreach (var i in t)
        {
            if (list.Contains(i))
                list.Remove(i);
            else
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```
