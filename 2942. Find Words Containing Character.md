# 2942. Find Words Containing Character
## Question ‚ùì <br>
 You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.

Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.

Note that the returned array may be in any order.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"   
Output: [0,1]   
Explanation:"e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1. 
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"  
Output: [0,2]    
Explanation:"a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
<br>

__Example 3:___
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"   
Output:[]   
Explanation:"z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
<br>
  
## Constraints:

- 1 <= words.length <= 50
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 50
- x is a lowercase English letter.
- words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

# Code
```c#
public class Solution {
    public IList<int> FindWordsContaining(string[] words, char x) {
        IList<int> result = new List<int>();
        for (int i=0;i<words.Length;i++)
     {
        if (words[i].Contains(x))
              result.Add(i);
     }
      return result;
    }
}
```
