# 389. Find the Difference
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

<br> 

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"  
Output: "e"      
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: s = "", t = "y"   
Output: "y"     
<br>
<br>
  
## Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 1000
- t.length == s.length + 1
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

# Code
```c#
public class Solution
{
    public char FindTheDifference(string s, string t)
    {
        var arr1 = s.ToCharArray();
        var arr2 = t.ToCharArray();
        Array.Sort(arr1);
        Array.Sort(arr2);
        for (int i = 0; i < s.Length; i++)
        {
            if (arr1[i] != arr2[i])
                return arr2[i];
        }
        return arr2[arr1.Length];
    }
}
```
