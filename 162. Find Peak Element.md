# 162. Find Peak Element
## Question ❓ <br>
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]   
Output: 2  
Explanation:  3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]    
Output: 5   
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- -2<sup>31</sup> <= nums[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
- nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

# Code
```c#
public class Solution
{
    public int FindPeakElement(int[] nums)
    {
        if (nums.Length == 1)
            return 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length - 1; i++)
        {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1])
                return i;
        }
        return nums.Length - 1;
    }
}
```
