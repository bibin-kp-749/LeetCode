# 476. Number Complement  
## Question ‚ùì <br>
The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

- For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.



  Given an integer num, return its complement.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: num = 5     
Output:2        
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: num = 1   
Output: 0          
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= num < 2<sup>31</sup>

# Code
```C#

public class Solution
{
    public int FindComplement(int num)
    {
        string Str = Convert.ToString(num, 2), newStr = "";
        foreach (var item in Str)
        {
            if (item == '0')
                newStr += '1';
            else
                newStr += "0";
        }
        return Convert.ToInt32(newStr, 2);
    }
}
```
