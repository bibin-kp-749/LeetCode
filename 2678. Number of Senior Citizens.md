# 2678. Number of Senior Citizens
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given a 0-indexed array of strings details. Each element of details provides information about a given passenger compressed into a string of length 15. The system is such that:

- The first ten characters consist of the phone number of passengers.
- The next character denotes the gender of the person.
- The following two characters are used to indicate the age of the person.
- The last two characters determine the seat allotted to that person.
Return the number of passengers who are strictly more than 60 years old.

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: details = ["7868190130M7522","5303914400F9211","9273338290F4010"]        
Output: 2         
Explanation: The passengers at indices 0, 1, and 2 have ages 75, 92, and 40. Thus, there are 2 people who are over 60 years old.

{
    public int CountSeniors(string[] details)
    {
        int count = 0;
        foreach (var i in details)
        {
            if (Convert.ToInt32(i[11].ToString() + i[12]) > 60)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
