# 3146. Permutation Difference between Two Strings
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given two strings s and t such that every character occurs at most once in s and t is a permutation of s.

The permutation difference between s and t is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each character in s and the index of the occurrence of the same character in t.

Return the permutation difference between s and t.

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: s = "abc", t = "bac"  
Output: 2   
Explanation: For s = "abc" and t = "bac", the permutation difference of s and t is equal to the sum of:
  
  The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "a" in s and the index of the occurrence of "a" in t.  
  The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "b" in s and the index of the occurrence of "b" in t.  
  The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "c" in s and the index of the occurrence of "c" in t.  
  That is, the permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 2.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: s = "abcde", t = "edbac"   
Output: 12   
Explanation: The permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 3| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 4| + |3 - 1| + |4 - 0| = 12.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 26
- Each character occurs at most once in s.
- t is a permutation of s.
- s consists only of lowercase English letters.

# Code
```C#
public class Solution {
    public int FindPermutationDifference(string s, string t) {
        int result=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.Length;i++)
        {
            int j=t.IndexOf(s[i]);
            result+= Math.Abs(i-j);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
