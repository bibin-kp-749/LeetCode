# 1773. Count Items Matching a Rule
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

- ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
- ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
- ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
  
Return the number of items that match the given rule.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"   
Output: 1      
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"]. 
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input:items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"    
Output: 2       
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= items.length <= 10 <sup> 4 </sup>
- 1 <= type<sub>i </sub>.length, color<sub>i </sub>.length, name<sub>i </sub>.length, ruleValue.length <= 10
- ruleKey is equal to either "type", "color", or "name".
- All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

# Code
```c#
public class Solution
{
    public int CountMatches(IList<IList<string>> items, string ruleKey, string ruleValue)
    {
        IList<string> arr = items.SelectMany(s => s).ToList();
        int i = 0, count = 0;
        if (ruleKey == "color")
            i = 1;
        if (ruleKey == "name")
            i = 2;
        for (; i < arr.Count; i += 3)
        {
            if (arr[i] == ruleValue)
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
