# 2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given an integer array nums. You need to create a 2D array from nums satisfying the following conditions:

- The 2D array should contain only the elements of the array nums.
- Each row in the 2D array contains distinct integers.
- The number of rows in the 2D array should be minimal.


Return the resulting array. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

<br>
  Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]    
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]      
Explanation: We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:      
  
 -1,3,4,2  
 -1,3  
 -1  
   
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]     
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]    
Explanation: All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.

__Example 3:__  Input: nums = [1,2,3]  
Output: 0
<br>
  
## Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 200
- 1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length


# Code
```C#
public class Solution
{
    public IList<IList<int>> FindMatrix(int[] nums)
    {
        var numbers = nums.ToList();
        IList<IList<int>> res = new List<IList<int>>();
        while (numbers.Count > 0)
        {
            List<int> unique = numbers.Distinct().ToList();
            foreach (int i in unique)
                numbers.Remove(i);
            res.Add(unique.ToList());
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
