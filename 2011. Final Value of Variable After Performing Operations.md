# 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations
## Question ‚ùì <br>
There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

- ++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
- --X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.


  Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]    
Output: 1  
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:  
Initially, X = 0.  
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.  
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.  
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]   
Output: 3   
Explanation:The operations are performed as follows:  
Initially, X = 0.  
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.  
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.  
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
<br>



      
__Example 3:__  Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]   
Output: 0  
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:  
Initially, X = 0.  
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.  
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.  
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 2 - 1 = 1.  
X--: X is decremented by 1, X = 1 - 1 = 0.
<br>
  
## Constraints:

- 1 <= operations.length <= 100
- operations[i] will be either "++X", "X++", "--X", or "X--".

# Code
```C#
public class Solution {
    public int FinalValueAfterOperations(string[] operations) {
        int sum = 0;
        foreach(string i in operations)
        {
            if (i == "--X" || i == "X--")
            sum--;
            if (i=="++X"||i=="X++")
            sum++;
        }
         return sum;
    }
}
```
