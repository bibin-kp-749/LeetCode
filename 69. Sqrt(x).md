# 69. Sqrt(x)
## Question ❓ <br>
Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: x = 4  
Output: 2   
Explanation:  The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input:  x = 8  
Output: 2     
Explanation:  The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

## Constraints:

- 0 <= x <= 2 <sup>31</sup> - 1

# Code
```c#
public class Solution
{
    public int MySqrt(int x) => Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor(Math.Sqrt(x)));
}

```
