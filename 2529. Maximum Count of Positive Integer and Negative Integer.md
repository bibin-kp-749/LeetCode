# 2529. Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer
## Question ‚ùì <br>
Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers.

- In other words, if the number of positive integers in nums is pos and the number of negative integers is neg, then return the maximum of pos and neg.


Note that 0 is neither positive nor negative.

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: nums = [-2,-1,-1,1,2,3]    
Output: 3   
Explanation: There are 3 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: nums = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,1,2]  
Output: 3     
Explanation: There are 2 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
<br>

__Example 3:__  Input: nums = [5,20,66,1314]  
Output: 4     
Explanation: There are 4 positive integers and 0 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 4.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2000
- -2000 <= nums[i] <= 2000
- nums is sorted in a non-decreasing order.

# Code
```c#
public class Solution
{
    public int MaximumCount(int[] nums)
    {
        int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
        foreach (int i in nums)
        {
            if (i > 0)
                count1++;
            if (i < 0)
                count2++;
        }
        if (count1 > count2)
            return count1;
        return count2;
    }
}

```
