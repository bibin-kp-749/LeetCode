# 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.
<br><br>

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]    
Output: 2          
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input:allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]       
Output: 7         
Explanation: All strings are consistent.
<br>

__Example 3:__  Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]      
Output: 4           
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= words.length <= 10 <sup> 4 </sup>
- 1 <= allowed.length <= 26
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
- The characters in allowed are distinct.
- words[i] and allowed contain only lowercase English letters.

# Code
```c#
public class Solution
{
    public int CountConsistentStrings(string allowed, string[] words)
    {
        bool isexist = true;
        int count = 0;
        foreach (string word in words)
        {
            foreach (var word2 in word)
            {
                if (!allowed.Contains(word2))
                    isexist = false;
            }
            if (isexist == true)
                count++;
            else
                isexist = true;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
