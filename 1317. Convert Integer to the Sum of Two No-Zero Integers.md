# 1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers
## Question ‚ùì <br>
No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:

- a and b are No-Zero integers.
- a + b = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input: n = 2   
Output: [1,1]     
Explanation:   
Let a = 1 and b = 1.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: n = 11   
Output: [2,9]     
Explanation: Let a = 2 and b = 9.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 9 = n.
Note that there are other valid answers as [8, 3] that can be accepted.

## Constraints:

- 2 <= n <= 10<pow> 4 </pow>

# Code
```C#
public class Solution
{
    public int[] GetNoZeroIntegers(int n)
    {
        int count = 1;
        int[] arr = new int[2];
        while (true)
        {
            int n1 = n - count, n2 = n - n1;
            if (!n1.ToString().Contains('0') && !n2.ToString().Contains('0'))
            {
                arr[0] = n1;
                arr[1] = n2;
                break;
            }
            count++;
        }
        return arr;
    }
}

```
