## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

## Constraints:

- n == names.length == heights.length
- 11 <= n <= 10 <sup>3</sup>
- 1 <= names[i].length <= 20
- 1 <= heights[i] <= 10 <sup>5</sup>
- names[i] consists of lower and upper case English letters.
- All the values of heights are distinct.



# Code
```C#
public class Solution
{
    public string[] SortPeople(string[] names, int[] heights)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < names.Length - 1; i++)
        {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < names.Length; j++)
            {
                if (heights[i] < heights[j])
                {
                    int temp1 = heights[i];
                    string temp2 = names[i];
                    heights[i] = heights[j];
                    names[i] = names[j];
                    heights[j] = temp1;
                    names[j] = temp2;
                }
            }
        }
        return names;
    }
}
