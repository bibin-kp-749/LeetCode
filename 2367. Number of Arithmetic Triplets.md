# 2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets
## Question ‚ùì <br>
You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff. A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:

- i < j < k,
- nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
- nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.
- Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

## Example

__Example 1:__
Input:  nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3  
Output: 2   
Explanation:(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both   
10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.
<br>

__Example 2:__  Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,8,9], diff = 2   
Output: 2   
Explanation: (0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.
(1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both   
9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.

## Constraints:

- 3 <= nums.length <= 200
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 200
- 1 <= diff <= 50
- nums is strictly increasing.

# Code
```C#
public class Solution
{
    public int ArithmeticTriplets(int[] nums, int diff)
    {
        int count = 0, flag = 0, temp = 0;
        for (int i = nums.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--)
            {
                if (nums[i] - nums[j] == diff)
                {
                    temp = nums[j];
                    flag++;
                }
                if (temp - nums[j] == diff)
                    flag++;
            }
            if (flag == 2)
                count++;
            flag = 0;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
